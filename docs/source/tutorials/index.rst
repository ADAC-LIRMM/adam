Welcome to the ADAM tutorials.
It's recommended to follow these tutorials in the order presented.
However, you may choose to follow a subset that aligns with your specific
interests, such as software development, which would primarily involve setup,
software, and possibly configuration tutorials.

1. :ref:`tutorial_setup`: Learn how to set up your environment and install the
   necessary tools for ADAM development.

2. :ref:`tutorial_simulation`: Understand how to run testbenches for validating
   your simulation configurations.

3. :ref:`tutorial_bitstream`:  Get acquainted with generating a bitstream for
   FPGA deployment using Vivado.

4. :ref:`tutorial_software`: Dive into compiling and running software
   applications on ADAM, including the process of loading and execution.

5. :ref:`tutorial_custom_configuration`: Explore how to configure ADAM for
   your specific development needs.
